**Filament KMP** brings the same physically based renderer that powers Android's Filament to **iOS**, **Desktop/JVM**, and **Web (JS & Wasm)** — as a plain Kotlin Multiplatform library, with an optional **Compose Multiplatform** layer on top.

> [!NOTE]
> **Unofficial project.** This is a community-maintained Kotlin Multiplatform wrapper around [Google's Filament](https://github.com/google/filament). It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Google or the Filament team.

```kotlin
FilamentSceneView(
    modifier       = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
    cameraState    = rememberCameraState(initialEye = Position(0f, 1f, 4f)),
    skyboxState    = rememberSkyboxState(SkyboxSource.Color(LinearColor(0.1f, 0.12f, 0.15f))),
    postProcessing = PostProcessing(bloom = Bloom(strength = 0.2f)),
) {
    DirectionalLight(direction = Direction(0.3f, -1f, -0.5f), intensity = LightIntensity.LuminousPower(100_000f))
    GltfInstance(asset = rememberGltfAsset { Res.readBytes("files/Duck.glb") })
}
```

The world is declared in the content lambda; the viewport's look is configured by value. Need several cameras over one world? Hoist the scene with `rememberFilamentScene { … }` and feed it to multiple `FilamentView`s.

**Not using Compose?** `filament`, `gltfio`, `filament-utils` and `filamat` are plain Kotlin bindings with no Compose dependency — drive `Engine` / `Renderer` / `SwapChain` yourself against your own `SurfaceView`, `CAMetalLayer`, GLFW window or `<canvas>`, or render headless and read the pixels back:

```kotlin
val engine    = Engine.create()!!
val swapChain = engine.createSwapChain(NativeSurface(myNativeWindow))
val renderer  = engine.createRenderer()

if (renderer.beginFrame(swapChain, frameTimeNanos)) {
    renderer.render(view)
    renderer.endFrame()
}
```

See **[Using the Engine Without Compose](docs/guide/engine.md)**.

## Platform support

Every platform runs on **one C API generated from Filament's C++ headers**, and the Kotlin API is written once in `commonMain` on top of it, so the API and its behavior are the same everywhere:

- **Android** — OpenGL ES / Vulkan, over JNI (`libfilament-c.so` per ABI)
- **iOS** — Metal, direct Kotlin/Native calls into the C API
- **Desktop / JVM** (macOS, Windows, Linux) — Metal / Vulkan / OpenGL, over JNI (`libfilament-c` per platform)
- **Web (JS & Wasm)** — WebGL 2.0, the C API compiled to wasm with Emscripten (`filament-kmp.wasm`)

**JVM requirements:** the Android artifacts ship JVM 11 bytecode (minSdk 24) and work with the standard Android `jvmTarget = 11` setup. The Desktop/JVM artifacts need **JDK 17+**, like Compose Desktop.

**Upgrading from 0.6.0?** The API now follows Filament's C++ headers and the native runtimes changed on every platform; follow the **[migration guide](docs/migration/from-0.6.0.md)**.

## Quick start

Add the Maven Central repository and depend on the modules you need:

```kotlin
// settings.gradle.kts
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        google()
    }
}
```

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        commonMain.dependencies {
            // Compose integration (pulls in the engine), or just "…:filament:0.7.8" without Compose.
            implementation("dev.nucleusframework.filament:filament-compose:0.7.8")
        }
    }
}
```

The same coordinates work on every target — Gradle resolves one variant per target you declare, so you don't download the platforms you don't build for. (The one exception: the Desktop/JVM natives default to all five desktop platforms; one snippet narrows them — see [what Gradle actually downloads](docs/guide/modules.md#what-gradle-actually-downloads).)

For the full setup (Compose Multiplatform plugin, native runtime for Desktop, iOS framework linking, Web prebuilts) see **[Getting Started](docs/guide/getting-started.md)**, and **[Modules](docs/guide/modules.md#dependencies-by-target)** for the per-target dependency table.

## Modules

| Artifact | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `filament` | Core renderer — `Engine`, `Scene`, `View`, `Renderer`, `Camera`, `Texture`, `Material`. No Compose dependency. |
| `filament-compose` | Compose Multiplatform integration — `rememberFilamentScene` / `FilamentView` (and the `FilamentSceneView` shortcut), scene DSL, camera state, value-based post-processing. |
| `gltfio` | glTF / GLB asset loading — `AssetLoader`, `FilamentAsset`, `Animator`. |
| `filamat` | Runtime material compilation — `MaterialBuilder`. |
| `filament-utils` | Camera manipulators, HDR/KTX loaders, math helpers. |

All published under `dev.nucleusframework.filament`. The Desktop/JVM native runtime (`filament-jni-desktop`) is pulled in automatically, with the natives in per-platform `filament-jni-runtime-<os>-<arch>` jars — all of them by default, or only your platform's if your build declares os/arch attributes (see [desktop/README.md](desktop/README.md)). See **[Modules](docs/guide/modules.md)** for full coordinates and dependency graph.

## Versioning & stability

Releases are plain `X.Y.Z` (no pre-release suffixes since `0.2.0`):

- **`X.Y.0` (minor)** — the normal release channel. Any change to the public API — new bindings from an upstream release of any kind, or wrapper API additions and changes — ships as a minor bump. New upstream **Filament feature releases** (1.73 → 1.74 → …) always land here. Breaking wrapper API changes may appear here and are always listed in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
- **`X.Y.Z` (patch)** — no API surface change: bug fixes in the wrapper, and upstream point releases picked up without binding anything new. Safe to pick up without reading anything.
- **`X.0.0` (major)** — reserved for maturity milestones and very large changes (a stabilized public API, a full architectural rework). Routine upstream tracking never triggers a major bump — expect minor releases to keep flowing for as long as Filament keeps releasing.

All `dev.nucleusframework.filament:*` artifacts share one version and must be upgraded together. The project is actively maintained long-term and tracks upstream Filament releases as they are published (see [docs/internals/upgrading-filament.md](docs/internals/upgrading-filament.md) for the process). Larger technical direction — like zero-copy GPU sharing with Compose — lives in the [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

## API strategy

The public API follows **Filament's C++ API**, the one [Filament's documentation](https://google.github.io/filament/Filament.md.html) and headers describe: the same classes, method names, owners and default values, on every platform. Adapted to Kotlin only where Kotlin has its own shape:

- **Kotlin properties** for getter/setter pairs and zero-argument getters (`view.scene`, `camera.focusDistance`, `engine.backend`, `engine.transformManager`, `engine.isPaused`); calls that take arguments or do work stay methods (`engine.getFeatureFlag(name)`, `engine.setActiveFeatureLevel(level)`).
- **Nullable results** where C++ can fail (`Engine.create()`, `Material.Builder.build()`), `AutoCloseable` on self-destroying types, overloads instead of per-type names (`engine.destroy(view)`, `engine.isValid(material)`).
- **Nothing invented**: no wrappers C++ doesn't have. Conveniences live in the optional **Compose DSL**, which keeps the raw `Engine` reachable through `FilamentEffect`.

How that API is produced, from C++ headers to a generated C API to Kotlin, is in [The Generated C API](docs/internals/c-api.md).
