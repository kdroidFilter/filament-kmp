# Roadmap

## Stability & long-term maintenance

With `0.2.0` the project dropped the `-beta` label: the major development phase and the
internal repository restructuring (prebuilt pipeline, vendored web externals, CI matrix,
API-surface enforcement) are done, and the focus shifts to tracking upstream and hardening.

- **Upstream tracking** — each Filament feature release (1.73 → 1.74 → …) is picked up as a
  minor release following [docs/upgrading-filament.md](docs/upgrading-filament.md);
  upstream point releases and wrapper fixes ship as patches. Minor releases are the ongoing
  channel — see [README → Versioning & stability](README.md#versioning--stability).
- **Path to `1.0.0`** — a major bump is reserved for maturity and very large changes: a
  stabilized public API and the known issue backlog worked down. It is not tied to any
  upstream Filament version. Until then, minor releases may still adjust public API (always
  listed in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md)).
- **Known gaps** — per-platform binding gaps are tracked via `@PlatformGap` and the coverage
  table in [Platform Notes](docs/platform-notes.md); web-specific limits now come only from
  WebGL and single-threaded wasm, since web calls our own C API.

## Upstream API consistency

Filament's per-language bindings are hand-written and drift apart: Android's Java API misses
parts of the C++ API, and each release reopens the gaps. JVM, iOS and web avoid this: all three
call our own C wrapper (`c/`), so a binding added there reaches all of them. Only Android, which
uses the official AAR, still depends on upstream's Java bindings.

- **Upstream is moving to generated bindings.** Filament is annotating its public C++ headers so
  bindings can be generated from them automatically —
  [google/filament#10410](https://github.com/google/filament/pull/10410) (`APIGEN` annotations and
  `Slice` APIs) is the first step.
- **What it means for us** — once the Android Java bindings are generated, they should cover the
  whole C++ API and the remaining Android `@PlatformGap`s can go. Until then we keep closing gaps
  per release with `./gradlew apiGaps`.

## Cross-platform GPU sharing & the Dawn convergence

> **Scope: `filament-compose` only.** This roadmap is about the display bridge in the
> `:kotlin:filament-compose` module — how Filament's offscreen output is presented inside Compose
> Multiplatform (skiko/Skia). It does **not** affect the core `:kotlin:filament` bindings, the
> material/scene APIs, or any other module; those work the same regardless of how the final image
> reaches the Compose canvas.
>
> Status: forward-looking. The interim approach (CPU readback everywhere, Metal GPU sharing on
> macOS) is what ships today; everything below is the plan for closing the Linux/Windows
> zero-copy gap.

### The problem

To display Filament's offscreen output inside Compose Multiplatform we hand a Filament-rendered
texture to skiko/Skia (which owns the Compose canvas). Doing this **without a CPU round-trip**
requires Filament and skiko to share a GPU resource. Whether that's possible comes down to the
GPU API's *resource model*:

- **Device-resource model** (Metal, D3D12, Vulkan, WebGPU): resources belong to the *device*.
  You wrap an externally-created texture on skiko's existing context — no context sharing needed.
  This is exactly why macOS works: Filament and skiko both use the system `MTLDevice`, so a
  Filament `MTLTexture` can be wrapped as a Skia `BackendRenderTarget`.
- **Context-resource model** (OpenGL): resources belong to a *context / share-group*. skiko would
  have to create Filament's context inside its own share-group and expose its `GLXContext`/`HGLRC`.
  skiko's legacy desktop GL redrawer does not do this — **this is the wall we hit on Linux.**

#### Where each platform stands today

| OS      | skiko backend (today) | Resource model | GPU sharing today |
|---------|-----------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| macOS   | Metal                 | device         | ✅ works (Metal texture wrap) |
| Windows | Direct3D 12           | device         | ⚠️ possible via Vulkan→D3D12 external-memory, not built |
| Linux   | OpenGL                | context        | ❌ blocked by skiko's legacy GL context handling |

Interim fallback on all platforms: **CPU readback** (`SwapChain` READABLE → `readPixels` →
`Image.makeRaster` → draw), double-buffered to pipeline the GPU→CPU copy. Correct everywhere,
but pays `W×H×4` of bandwidth per frame.

### The endgame: both halves migrate to Dawn

The clean, universal fix is for **both** sides to render on **Dawn** (Google's native WebGPU
implementation, backed by D3D12 / Metal / Vulkan):

- **skiko → Graphite → Dawn/Vulkan.** Skia's next-gen backend (Graphite) is designed around
  modern device-model APIs (Metal, Vulkan, Dawn, D3D12). When skiko migrates off Ganesh, a
  Vulkan/Dawn desktop backend arrives with it.
- **Filament → WebGPU → Dawn.** Filament already has a WebGPU backend that runs on desktop
  natively via Dawn (not web-only). It's experimental and behind a build flag today, but actively
  developed by Google.

WebGPU is a device-resource model, and Dawn supports shared/external texture memory. So once both
halves are on Dawn, sharing reduces to: **create one `WGPUDevice`, render both Filament and skiko
on it, wrap Filament's `wgpu::Texture` on skiko's Graphite recorder.** This is cleaner than raw
Vulkan because there is no per-OS VK↔D3D12↔GL import glue — both sides speak the same Dawn device
on every platform, and it dissolves the Linux GL-context wall entirely. It also subsumes the
existing macOS Metal path and the web path into one model.

#### The two waits are the same bet

| Layer    | Today                       | Target              | Status |
|----------|-----------------------------|---------------------|--------|
| skiko    | Ganesh (GL / D3D12 / Metal) | Graphite + Dawn/Vulkan | Major issue, staffed (JetBrains internship), no public date |
| Filament | OpenGL / Vulkan / Metal     | WebGPU / Dawn       | Experimental, active, behind a build flag |

Both must land **together** for the shared-Dawn-device payoff. Realistic horizon: 2026–2027.

### Interim options (until Dawn convergence lands)

1. **Keep CPU readback** as the universal fallback (current `main`).
2. **macOS Metal sharing** — already proven; the device-model wrap pattern.
3. **Filament external-memory export patch** — patch Filament's Vulkan backend to export the render
   target as external memory (opaque-FD on Linux, NT-handle on Windows), then import into skiko's
   native API (D3D12 on Windows, GL via `GL_EXT_memory_object_fd` on Linux). Highest cost, but the
   work carries straight over to the Dawn endgame.
4. **Native overlay / hole-punch** — render Filament's native `SwapChain` into a child surface
   layered into the Compose window (`compose.interop.blending` for z-order). Zero readback, no
   skiko cooperation, no engine patch — but can't blend Compose between 3D layers.

### What we can do now

The Filament half is the half we control. Concretely: build Filament with the WebGPU/Dawn backend
enabled on desktop (`WEBGPU_OPTION` / `-Wj` in `build.sh`) and run the existing samples against it
to gauge how close that half already is. skiko's half we can only watch.

### Findings: reaching skiko's context (2026-09-29)

Wrapping a foreign texture on skiko's Ganesh context has been public API since 2021
(`BackendRenderTarget.makeMetal` / `makeDirect3D` / `makeGL` → `Surface.makeFromBackendRenderTarget`
→ `makeImageSnapshot`). The missing piece is *finding Compose's context*, which the macOS path does
by reflection.

- **`Canvas.recordingContext` doesn't help inside Compose.** skiko 0.152 made it public
  ([JetBrains/skiko#1219](https://github.com/JetBrains/skiko/pull/1219), shipped with Compose
  `1.13.0-alpha01`). Probed on macOS/Metal: it returns `null` on every frame, both in
  `drawBehind` and in a wrapped `SkiaLayer.renderDelegate`. On AWT, skiko records every public
  draw hook into a `PictureRecorder`; only its internal redrawer ever touches the GPU surface.
- **skiko-graphite doesn't help yet.** `Surface.wrapBackendTexture` needs a Graphite `Recorder`,
  and Compose's AWT redrawers are still Ganesh-only.
- **Vulkan can't be forced.** `SKIKO_RENDER_API` has no `VULKAN` value (it falls back to the OS
  default), and there's no Vulkan AWT redrawer, so Filament Vulkan ↔ skiko Vulkan isn't possible yet.

Recheck when Compose exposes its context publicly or skiko ships a Graphite AWT redrawer.
