# Upgrading the Filament version

This guide walks through bumping `filament-kmp` to a new upstream Filament release —
from scoping the diff, to refreshing prebuilts, to adding/removing binding surface
across all five platforms, to verifying the result.

It is written for contributors. If you only *consume* the library, you never need this.

---

## Mental model: why an upgrade touches many layers

`filament-kmp` is a thin wrapper. Every platform binds the same C API (`c/`, the `Fila*`
functions), and the Kotlin API is written once in `commonMain` on top of it (see
[Native Bindings](bindings.md)). A new Filament method is generated up to the Kotlin wrapper:

| Layer | Where | Written by |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **C API** | `c/<module>/generated` | `./gradlew generateCApi`, from the headers in `c/api-headers.txt` |
| **C API leftovers** | `c/<module>/manual` | hand, for each `TODO(handwritten)` the generator leaves |
| **Kotlin externals** | `kotlin/<module>/src/commonMain/.../capi` | `./gradlew generateKotlinExternals` |
| **Kotlin API** | `kotlin/<module>/src/commonMain` | hand: the public method over the externals |

Everything after that is derived: the JNI forwarders are generated from the externals at build
time, Native calls the C symbol directly, and web finds it in the wasm exports.

### Two sources of truth

- **Filament C++ API → our C API (`c/`).** The C shims follow the C++ headers; all platforms bind
  the same `Fila*` functions, so there is no separate per-platform surface to audit.
- **Our C API → the Kotlin externals.** Every `Fila*` function gets a common `external fun`.

`./gradlew apiCoverage` audits both, and what of the C API the public Kotlin API calls.

## TL;DR checklist

```sh
# 1. Scope the change (tags optional: defaults to filaVersion → latest upstream release)
scripts/dev/upgrade-diff.sh --summary                    # then re-run without --summary on hot areas

# 2. Bump the version
#    edit gradle.properties -> filaVersion=<new>

# 3. Refresh prebuilts (version-stamped: redone automatically on a version bump)
./gradlew prebuilts prebuilts_wasm                       # libs + headers at <new>; wasm is a source build (slow)

# 4. Regenerate the C API and the Kotlin externals, then review their diff
./gradlew generateCApi generateKotlinExternals
./gradlew apiCoverage                                    # then git diff c/api-coverage.txt: what's new, bound, unbound, undeclared

# 5. Adapt the Kotlin API (per-layer recipe below), update tests
scripts/dev/rebuild-materials.sh                         # recompile every .filamat when MATERIAL_VERSION changed

# 6. Verify
scripts/dev/run-tests.sh                                 # jvm + js + wasm + ios + android
```

---

## Step by step

### 1. Scope the diff

```sh
scripts/dev/upgrade-diff.sh --summary                 # filaVersion → latest upstream release
scripts/dev/upgrade-diff.sh v1.71.6 --summary         # filaVersion → explicit tag
scripts/dev/upgrade-diff.sh v1.71.5 v1.71.6 --summary # explicit old and new
```

The report opens with a **HIGHLIGHTS** section that extracts the historically surprising
bits so they can't be missed in a big diff: the `MATERIAL_VERSION` bump, `CONFIG_MAX_*`
changes, feature-flag additions/default flips, and added/removed Android Java classes.

Below that, it diffs the upstream tree between the two tags across every surface that drives our bindings:
public C++ headers, backend headers, **Android Java sources**, material/engine enums,
feature-flag defaults, and `RELEASE_NOTES.md`. First run clones upstream into
`scripts/dev/.filament-src-cache/` (~200 MB, gitignored); later runs reuse it.

Start with `--summary` to see *which files* changed, then re-run **without** `--summary` on the
interesting areas for full unified diffs. Pay particular attention to:

- **Public C++ headers** — the source of truth. Anything added here is generated in step 4;
  what matters now is renames, removals and changed defaults, which break or silently change
  the Kotlin wrappers. (The Android Java diff is context only: the Kotlin API follows C++.)
- **`MATERIAL_VERSION`** (in `MaterialEnums.h`) — any change means every shipped `.filamat` must
  be recompiled with the new `matc`.
- **`CONFIG_MAX_INSTANCES`** and other WebGL workaround constants — relevant to the
  "uniform buffer too small" class of bugs.
- **`FeatureFlagManager.h`** defaults — silent behavior flips between releases.
- **`RELEASE_NOTES.md`** — often the only place behavior-only changes (no API delta) are written
  down.

### 2. Bump `filaVersion`

Edit [`gradle.properties`](../../gradle.properties):

```properties
filaVersion=1.71.6
```

### 3. Refresh the prebuilts

Both libraries and headers are version-stamped: each `prebuilts_<id>` task takes `filaVersion` as
an input and records a stamp inside `prebuilts/<id>/lib`, redoing the work on any mismatch. Bumping
`filaVersion` and building is enough — stale header/library mixes (the old `symbol(s) not found`
linker-error class) can no longer happen silently.

```sh
./gradlew prebuilts prebuilts_wasm
```

`prebuilts/` is gitignored, so deleting it is safe. Upstream publishes no wasm (or windows-arm64)
static libraries, so those `prebuilts_<id>` tasks build them from the release's source tarball
(`BuildFromSourceTask`: host tools, then the Emscripten build with `libfilamat`). CI caches the result
per `filaVersion`. Also check upstream `BUILDING.md` for a new emsdk version and bump `emsdkVersion` in
`gradle.properties` to match.

### 4. Regenerate and audit

```sh
./gradlew generateCApi generateKotlinExternals
./gradlew apiCoverage    # rewrites c/api-coverage.txt; review its diff
./gradlew apiGaps        # cross-check by symbol: build/reports/api-gaps.txt
```

Review the diff in `c/*/generated/` and the `capi/` packages: it is the whole C-level change of the
release. What to look for:

- **A skip entry in `c/api-headers.txt` that names nothing** fails `generateCApi`: upstream removed or
  renamed the declaration. Delete or update the entry.
- **New `TODO(handwritten)` comments**: new API the generator can't bridge. Write it in
  `c/<module>/manual`, skip it with a reason, or teach the generator the shape.
- **Changed or removed externals** break the Kotlin wrappers that call them at compile time. Fix them to
  match the new C++.

The C++ side is compared by symbol, never by parsing names: the public methods of every `*_PUBLIC`
class as clang's AST reports them (inline ones included), plus template instances only the
libraries define, minus every symbol the `c/` objects mention when built at `-O0` (so inline calls
stay calls). Struct fields and enum values aren't covered there: new enum values and class constants show as
`undeclared` in `c/api-coverage.txt`. The task runs on macOS and Linux hosts (it needs
`clang++`, `nm` and `c++filt`).

### 5. Apply the changes

#### Adding a method

Step 4 already generated the new method's `Fila*` function and Kotlin external (or a
`TODO(handwritten)`). Use `build/reports/api-gaps.txt` and the externals diff as the worklist, and call
the external from the Kotlin class that owns the method in C++, with C++'s name and defaults, e.g. for
`ColorGrading::Builder::fastMath(bool)`:

```kotlin
fun fastMath(fastMath: Boolean): Builder = apply { FilaColorGradingBuilder_fastMath(nativeBuilder, fastMath) }
```

API the header only declares under an `#if` (e.g. `UTILS_HAS_THREADING`) is still generated on every
target; where the condition is false it panics, so give the Kotlin side a `@PlatformGap`.

#### Removing / deprecating a method

A removed C++ method disappears from the regenerated C API, so the Kotlin wrapper calling it stops
compiling: delete it (the project removes deprecated API outright rather than keeping shims). A method
upstream only marks deprecated stays generated; drop it from the Kotlin API in the same release. Either
way, list it in the changelog.

### 6. Update tests

Add the new methods to the existing builder-chain tests in `commonTest`
(`ColorGradingTest`, `MaterialBuilderTest`, `EngineTest`, …) so all five targets exercise them.
A builder method just needs to appear in the chain; a method with observable behavior deserves an
assertion.

### 6b. Regenerate the embedded standard materials

`filament-compose` ships five precompiled built-in materials (`StandardMaterial.Lit`/`Unlit`/
`Textured`/`Emissive`/`Transparent`) as embedded `.filamat` blobs — their `.mat` sources and compiled outputs live
in [`kotlin/filament-compose/src/commonMain/materials/`](../../kotlin/filament-compose/src/commonMain/materials/),
and the `generateEmbeddedMaterials` Gradle task base64-encodes them into a generated Kotlin object.

A compiled `.filamat` is tied to the Filament ABI, so **whenever `MATERIAL_VERSION` changes** (watch
the step-1 diff), every committed blob must be recompiled with the `matc` of the matching release —
including the two that live outside `filament-compose` (the `emissive` test material and the
`textured` sample material):

```sh
scripts/dev/rebuild-materials.sh
```

The script pulls `matc` out of the release tarball cached by step 3, recompiles every `.mat` in the
repo in place and syncs the shared `emissive.filamat` copy. Commit the refreshed blobs; the embed
tasks pick them up on the next build. `StandardMaterialLifecycleTest` (Tier-B) fails to build a
material if a blob is stale or corrupt.

### 7. Verify

```sh
scripts/dev/run-tests.sh                 # everything the host supports
# or scope it:
scripts/dev/run-tests.sh jvm js          # specific targets
```

The matrix that actually matters per binding path:

| Target | Validates |
| :--- | :--- |
| `:kotlin:*:jvmTest` | C shim rebuild + JNI glue — the desktop `libfilament-c` links against the new prebuilts |
| `:kotlin:*:jsTest`, `:kotlin:*:wasmJsTest` | the wasm links against the new `prebuilts/wasm` and exports every `Fila*` the Kotlin side binds |
| `:kotlin:*:iosSimulatorArm64Test` | C shim + direct `@SymbolName` calls resolve at link time |
| `:kotlin:*:connectedAndroidDeviceTest` | the Android `.so` + JNI glue per ABI (needs a device/emulator) |

A green `jvmTest`/`iosSimulatorArm64Test` is strong evidence the C shim links and the new symbols
resolve against the refreshed prebuilts. A green `jsTest` proves the same for the wasm build.

Finally, walk the samples on each platform — silent renderer behavior changes (default values in
`BloomOptions`, `FogOptions`, etc.) don't show up in any header diff.
