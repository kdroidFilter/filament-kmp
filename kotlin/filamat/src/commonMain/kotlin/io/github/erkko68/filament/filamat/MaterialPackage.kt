/**
 * MaterialPackage holds the compiled binary data of a Filament material.
 *
 * A MaterialPackage is produced by MaterialBuilder after material source code compilation.
 * It contains optimized shader code for multiple backends (OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, WebGPU),
 * material metadata, and parameter definitions.
 *
 * **Usage:**
 * After building a MaterialPackage with MaterialBuilder, pass the package data to
 * Filament's Material system via Engine.Material creation. The package is self-contained
 * and can be serialized, cached, or transmitted.
 *
 * **Validity:**
 * Always check isValid() before using a package. An invalid package indicates compilation
 * failure and should be discarded.
