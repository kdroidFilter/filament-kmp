/**
 * Hoisted, observable playback state for a single glTF [Animator], created with
 * [rememberAnimationState] and passed to [GltfInstance]. It auto-advances on every frame and
 * drives the animator each frame in one of two modes:
 *
 * **Single-track (the convenience path).** Set [animationIndex] and the active clip plays, looping
 * at its length; assigning a new index cross-fades from the outgoing clip over [crossFadeDuration].
 * This covers the common "play idle, blend into walk" case without touching the mixer.
 *
 * **Multi-track [mixer].** Add tracks with [rememberAnimationTrack] and the state blends them by
 * [AnimationTrack.weight] every frame — a blend tree (e.g. idle↔walk↔run driven by a speed parameter).
 * While the [mixer] has tracks it takes precedence and [animationIndex] is ignored. Filament blends two
 * clips per call, but weighted cross-fades chain, so an arbitrary number of weighted clips compose into
 * one pose.
 *
 * For an imperative game loop (an animation state machine outside composition), use [AnimationMixer]
 * directly instead of this hoisted state — see [rememberAnimationMixer].
 *
 * Per-bone masks and additive layers are *not* expressible — the native animator blends the whole
 * skeleton. For that, or any fully manual control, use [GltfInstance]'s `onUpdate` and call the
 * [Animator] directly.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // Single-track with auto cross-fade:
 * val anim = rememberAnimationState(initialAnimationIndex = idle, initialCrossFadeDuration = 0.25f)
 * GltfInstance(asset = character, animationState = anim)
 * anim.animationIndex = walk   // cross-fades
 *
 * // Blend tree — hold both clips and drive the weight from a parameter:
 * val anim = rememberAnimationState(initialAnimationIndex = null)
 * rememberAnimationTrack(anim, walkIndex, weight = 1f - speed)
 * rememberAnimationTrack(anim, runIndex,  weight = speed)
 * ```

 * This is plain state with no `@Composable` entry point, so it suits an **imperative game loop**:
 * hold a mixer (e.g. via [rememberAnimationMixer]), mutate track weights from your own animation
 * state machine, and call [apply] every frame with the instance's [Animator] and the frame delta:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val mixer = rememberAnimationMixer()

 * GltfInstance(asset = character, onCreate = { animator = instance.animator })

 *     walk.weight = 1f - moveSpeed; run.weight = moveSpeed
 *     animator?.let { mixer.apply(it, frame.deltaSeconds) }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * In Compose, [AnimationState] already wraps one of these as [AnimationState.mixer] and drives [apply]
 * for you; [rememberAnimationTrack] is declarative sugar over [addTrack].
 *
 * Filament blends the whole skeleton per call, so per-bone masks and additive layers are not
 * expressible — drive the [Animator] yourself for that.
