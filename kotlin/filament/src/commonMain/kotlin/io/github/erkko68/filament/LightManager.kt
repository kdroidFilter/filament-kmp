/**
 * LightManager allows you to create light sources in the scene.
 *
 * At least one light must be added to a scene to see anything (unless using [Material.Shading.UNLIT]).
 *
 * **Light types** (directional, point, spot):
 * - Directional lights: parallel rays from infinitely far (e.g., sun); cast shadows
 * - Point lights: emit from a position in all directions; intensity diminishes with inverse square law
 * - Spot lights: emit from a position within a cone; two cone angles control falloff
 *
 * **Performance tips:**
 * - Prefer spot lights over point lights; use smallest outer cone angle possible
 * - Use smallest falloff distance to minimize sphere-of-influence overlap
 * - Non-overlapping lights have negligible overhead (hundreds are fine)
 *
 * **Shadow support:**
 * - Only directional and spot lights can cast shadows
 * - Configure shadows via [Builder.shadowOptions] and [ShadowOptions]
