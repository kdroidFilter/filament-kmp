/**
 * Marks a common API whose platform binding is missing or degraded on the listed platforms.
 *
 * The API exists in `commonMain` so shared code compiles everywhere, but the platform `actual`
 * cannot reach the underlying engine feature — e.g. WebGL or single-threaded wasm lacks it, or the
 * Android SDK doesn't expose it. [behavior] states exactly what the call does
 * there: throws `UnsupportedOperationException`, is a silent no-op, or returns a placeholder.
 *
 * The full per-platform coverage table lives in
 * [Platform Notes](https://github.com/Erkko68/filament-kmp/blob/main/docs/guide/platform-notes.md).
 *
 * @property platforms Platforms on which the binding is missing or degraded.
 * @property behavior What calling the API does on those platforms.
