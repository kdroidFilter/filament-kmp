/**
 * Skybox renders a background environment cube around the camera.
 *
 * When added to a Scene, the Skybox fills all untouched pixels. The Skybox is rendered as
 * though the camera is inside an infinitely large cube with the cubemap mapped to its exterior.
 * This allows rendering a background environment that follows the camera's orientation.
 *
 * **Creation and destruction:**
 * Create a Skybox with the Builder and destroy with Engine.destroy(skybox).
 *
 * ```
 * val skybox = Skybox.Builder()
 *     .environment(cubemap)
 *     .build(engine)
 * // later:
 * engine.destroy(skybox)
 * ```
 *
 * **Note:** The Skybox and IndirectLight both render backgrounds. Currently, only Texture-based
 * skyboxes are supported. The Skybox typically uses lower-resolution cubemaps for visual appearance,
 * while IndirectLight provides the high-quality irradiance for lighting calculations.
 *
 * @see Scene.setSkybox
 * @see IndirectLight
