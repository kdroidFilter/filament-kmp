/**
 * Stream is used to attach a video stream to a Filament Texture.
 *
 * The Stream class is fairly platform-centric. It supports two different configurations:
 *
 * - **NATIVE**: Connects to a native OS stream (e.g., Android SurfaceTexture)
 * - **ACQUIRED**: Connects to an external source (e.g., Android AHardwareBuffer)
 *
 * Before explaining these different configurations, let's review the high-level structure of an AR
 * or video application that uses Filament:
 *
 * ```
 * while (true) {
 *     // Application work: write frame data, move camera, etc.
 *
 *     if (renderer.beginFrame(swapChain)) {
 *         renderer.render(view)
 *         renderer.endFrame()
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Let's say that the video image data at the time of a particular invocation of `beginFrame()`
 * becomes visible to users at time A. The 3D scene state (including camera) at that same
 * invocation becomes apparent to users at time B.
 *
 * - If time A matches time B, the stream is **synchronized**.
 * - Filament invokes low-level graphics commands on the **driver thread**.
 * - The thread that calls `beginFrame()` is called the **main thread**.
 *
 * For ACQUIRED streams, Filament explicitly acquires the stream, then releases it later via a
 * callback function. This configuration is especially useful when the Vulkan backend is enabled.
 *
 * NATIVE streams are deprecated because they are backend-specific and do not make any
 * synchronization guarantee.
 *
 * @see Texture
 * @see TextureSampler
